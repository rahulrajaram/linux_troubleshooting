## Binaries & ELF

Cheat Card
- Linked libs: `ldd /path/to/bin` (security caveat: may execute code in rare cases)
- ELF headers/sections: `readelf -h /bin/ls`; sections: `readelf -S /bin/ls`
- Symbols (prefer readelf): `readelf -Ws /bin/ls | grep ' FUNC '`; dynamic: `readelf -Ws -d /bin/ls`
- Disassemble: `objdump -d /bin/ls | less` (add `-M intel` for Intel syntax)
- Symbols via nm: `nm -D /bin/ls | grep symbol_name`
- Requires: binutils (readelf/objdump/nm)

## 1. ldd

List shared library dependencies of executables and shared objects.
- Basic: `ldd /path/to/bin`
- Security caveat: may execute code in rare cases; avoid on untrusted binaries.
- Alternative: `LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1 /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /path/to/bin` (still uses loader)

## Text & Data Utilities

Cheat Card

- Edit in-place: `sed -i.bak -E 's/old/new/g' file` (backup)
- Summarize data: `awk -F, '{a[$1]+=$2} END{for(k in a) print k,a[k]}' file.csv`
- JSON parse: `jq -r '.items[].metadata.name' file.json`
- Compare dirs: `diff -ruN dir_old dir_new | less -R`
- Transform text: `tr -s ' ' | cut -d, -f1,3 | xargs -n1 echo`
- Safe temp: `mktemp -d` for dirs; files: `mktemp`
- Reverse lines: `rev <file` (quick visual check)

## 2. grep

- search for one or more expressions: `grep -E 'hello|world' temp`
- search for one or more words: `grep -Ew 'hello|world' temp`
- search for suffix matches: `grep -E 'hello(world|lolo)' temp`
- search for suffixes matching regex: `grep -E 'hello[0-9]{3,}' temp`
- recursive search in tree: `grep -RIn --exclude-dir .git --exclude='*.log' 'pattern' .`
- fixed strings (fast) and ignore case: `grep -Fni 'literal text' file`
- context lines: `grep -R --color -n -C2 'pattern' .` (or `-A` after, `-B` before)
- binary-skip and file names only: `grep -rI -l 'pattern' .`

## 3. sed

What it does: stream editor for non-interactive find/replace, line edits, and range selections.

- In-place with backup: `sed -i.bak -E 's/old/new/g' file`

- Print lines between markers: `sed -n '/BEGIN/,/END/p' file`
- Replace with capture groups: `sed -E 's/([0-9]{4})-([0-9]{2})-([0-9]{2})/\3-\2-\1/' file`
- Insert before/after match:
  - Before: `sed '/pattern/i\\inserted before' file`
  - After:  `sed '/pattern/a\\appended after' file`
- Trim trailing spaces: `sed -i 's/[ \t]\+$//' file`
- Multiple edits: `sed -E -e 's/foo/bar/g' -e '/tmp/d' file`

## 4. awk

What it does: text processing and quick data summarization using fields and expressions.

- Default FS is whitespace; set CSV FS: `awk -F, '...' file.csv`
- Select fields: `awk '{print $1, $3}' file`
- Filter rows: `awk '$5 > 100 {print $1, $5}' file`
- Sum a column: `awk '{s+=$3} END{print s}' file`
- Group and sum by key: `awk '{a[$1]+=$2} END{for (k in a) print k, a[k]}' file`
- Pretty print: `awk '{printf "%-20s %10d\n", $1, $2}' file`
- Count unique values: `awk '{c[$1]++} END{for (k in c) print k, c[k]}' file`

<summary>Metrics reference (click to expand)</summary>

  - `Time` - The time corresponding to the end of the sample shown, in HH:MM:SS format (24-hour clock).
  - `Int` - The interface name.
  - `rKB/s, InKB` - Kilobytes/second read (received).
  - `wKB/s, OutKB` - Kilobytes/second written (transmitted).

  - `wMbps, WrMbps` - Megabits/second written (transmitted).
  - `rPk/s, InSeg, InDG` - Packets (TCP Segments, UDP Datagrams)/second read (received).

  - `rAvs` - Average size of packets read (received).
  - `wAvs` - Average size of packets written (transmitted).
  - `%Util` - Percentage utilization of the interface. For full-duplex
    interfaces, this is the greater of rKB/s or wKB/s as a percentage of the
    interface speed. For half-duplex interfaces, rKB/s and wKB/s are summed.
  - `%rUtil, %wUtil` - Percentage utilization for bytes read and written, respectively.
  - `Sat` - Saturation. This the number of errors/second seen for the interface
    - an indicator the interface may be approaching saturation. This statistic
    is combined from a number of kernel statistics. It is recommended to use
    the '-x' option to see more individual statistics (those mentioned below)
    when attempting to diagnose a network issue.
  - `IErr` - Packets received that could not be processed because they contained errors
  - `OErr` - Packets that were not successfully transmitted because of errors
  - `Coll` - Ethernet collisions during transmit.
  - `NoCP` - No-can-puts. This is when an incoming packet can not be put to the
    process reading the socket. This suggests the local process is unable to
    process incoming packets in a timely manner.
  - `Defer` - Defer Transmits. Packets without collisions where first transmit
    attempt was delayed because the medium was busy.
  - `Reset` - tcpEstabResets. The number of times TCP connections have made a
    direct transition to the CLOSED state from either the ESTABLISHED state or
    the CLOSE-WAIT state.
  - `AttF` - tcpAttemptFails - The number of times that TCP connections have
    made a direct transition to the CLOSED state from either the SYN-SENT state
    or the SYN-RCVD state, plus the number of times TCP connections have made a
    direct transition to the LISTEN state from the SYN-RCVD state.
  - `%ReTX` - Percentage of TCP segments retransmitted - that is, the number of
    TCP segments transmitted containing one or more previously transmitted
    octets.
  - `InConn` - tcpPassiveOpens - The number of times that TCP connections have
    made a direct transition to the SYN-RCVD state from the LISTEN state.
  - `OutCon` - tcpActiveOpens - The number of times that TCP connections have
    made a direct transition to the SYN-SENT state from the CLOSED state.
  - `Drops` - tcpHalfOpenDrop + tcpListenDrop + tcpListenDropQ0. tcpListenDrop
    and tcpListenDropQ0 - Number of connections dropped from the completed
    connection queue and incomplete connection queue, respectively.
    tcpHalfOpenDrops - Number of connections dropped after the initial SYN
    packet was received.

## 14. dd (DANGER: DESTRUCTIVE â€” READ FIRST)

- Compat: Linux; Root required for raw devices; Highly destructive when writing; Requires: coreutils.

- Danger: dd will overwrite data with no confirmation. Double-check devices
  (e.g., `/dev/sdX`) and consider read-only or safer alternatives first. Use
  `lsblk`, `blkid` to verify targets.
- Safer tips: for copies, consider `pv` to visualize throughput; for imaging,
  `dcfldd`; for testing, prefer non-destructive reads.

```bash
# Danger: wipes target disk. Verify device with lsblk/blkid.
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=4k status=progress
```

```bash
# Verify a drive is zeroed (non-zero bytes check)
dd if=/dev/sda status=none | hexdump -C | grep -q '[^00]' || echo "All zeros"
```

```bash
# Fill a file with random data (example size)
dd if=/dev/urandom of=myfile bs=6703104 count=1 status=progress
```

```bash
# Danger: clone a partition to another (same size/align). Verify both!
dd if=/dev/sda3 of=/dev/sdb3 bs=4096 status=progress conv=fsync
```

```bash
# Danger: write an image to a USB device. Verify device path first!
dd if=/path/to/bootimage.img of=/dev/sdc bs=4M status=progress conv=fsync
```

```bash
# Quick r/w benchmark for a file (non-destructive read + temp write)
dd if=/home/$user/bigfile of=/dev/null status=progress
dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/$user/bigfile bs=1M count=1000 oflag=dsync status=progress
```

```bash
# Sequential device read throughput sample (approx 1 GiB)
dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null bs=1024k count=1024 status=progress
```

```bash
# Create a swapfile (example: 8 GiB), then mkswap + swapon
dd if=/dev/zero of=swapfile bs=1MiB count=$((8*1024)) status=progress
```

## 15. jq

- Compat: Linux; Requires: jq package.

What it does: parse/query/transform JSON on the command line. Requires: jq.

- Pretty-print: `jq . file.json`
- Extract field list: `jq -r '.items[].metadata.name' file.json`
- Filter by condition: `jq '.[] | select(.status=="RUNNING")' file.json`
- Transform and count: `jq '[.[] | .level] | group_by(.) | map({level: .[0], count: length})' file.json`
- Sort and top N: `jq 'sort_by(.time) | reverse | .[0:5]' file.json`
- From journald: `journalctl -o json | jq -r 'select(.PRIORITY<=3) | .MESSAGE'`
```bash
# Requires: jq â€” show high-priority messages from journald
journalctl -o json | jq -r 'select(.PRIORITY<=3) | .MESSAGE'
```

- apply a patch: `patch -p1 < change.diff`

## 17. uname

- Compat: Linux; Requires: coreutils.

- get all details about the computer

## 18. sync/fsync

- Compat: Linux; `sync` is user command; `fsync` is a syscall.

- `fsync` is a syscall that flushes a file's in-memory data and metadata to
  storage. From the shell, use `sync` (flush all dirty data) or `syncfs` (flush
  a filesystem) when available.

## 19. mkswap

- Compat: Linux; Root required; Requires: util-linux.

- `-c`: check if blocks are corrupted
- `-p`: set pagesize

## 20. fsck

- Compat: Linux; Root required; Avoid on mounted filesystems; Requires: e2fsprogs for ext*.

- check for file system consistency:
  - The superblock is checked for inconsistencies in:
    - File system size
    - Number of inodes
    - Free-block count
    - Free-inode count
  - Each inode is checked for inconsistencies in:
    - Format and type
    - Link count
    - Duplicate block
    - Bad block numbers
    - Inode size
- see: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/805-7228/6j6q7uf0e/index.html
- Caution: avoid running fsck on a mounted filesystem (except with specific fs
  support); prefer read-only mounts or maintenance windows.

Extended notes
- ext* specifics: `e2fsck` checks ext2/3/4; use `-f` to force, `-n` for read-only,
  `-p` for preen (auto-fix safe issues). Requires: e2fsprogs.
- Bad blocks (DANGER): `badblocks` scans devices for bad sectors; write-mode is
  destructive. Prefer read-only first.

Examples
```bash
# Read-only badblocks scan (non-destructive)
sudo badblocks -sv /dev/sdX

# DANGER: write-mode destructive scan â€” data loss
sudo badblocks -wsv /dev/sdX

# ext* filesystem check (read-only)
sudo e2fsck -fn /dev/sdXN
```

  `/etc/sysctl.d/*.conf` after validation.
- Read a key: `sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control`
- Set a key (runtime): `sysctl -w vm.swappiness=10`
- Persist: create `/etc/sysctl.d/99-local.conf` with `vm.swappiness = 10`, then `sysctl --system`

## Processes & Scheduling

Cheat Card
- Top offenders: `ps -eo pid,ppid,user,%cpu,%mem,cmd --sort=-%cpu | head`
- Threads view: `top -H` or `ps -Lp <pid> -o pid,tid,pcpu,comm`
- Target processes:
```bash
# Preview before signaling
pgrep -a <name>

# Then send a scoped, safe signal (example: TERM)
pkill -TERM -u <user> -f '<exact-pattern>'
```
- Over time: `pidstat -u 1 -p <pid>` (CPU) and `pidstat -d 1` (IO)
- Find PIDs: `pidof <proc>`; list threads: `ps -Lp <pid>`
- Niceness: start `nice -n 10 cmd`; adjust: `renice -n 10 -p <pid>`
- Locks: `/proc/locks` shows current file locks (read-only)
- Sessions: users `who`; recent logins `last | head`
- Schedule: `crontab -l` list; `crontab -e` edit

- Deprecated in many distros; prefer `ss`.
- Common mappings:
  - `netstat -tulpn` -> `ss -tulpn`
  - `netstat -anp` -> `ss -anp`
  - `netstat -s` -> `ss -s`

- `b` blocked processes (often IO wait); correlate with `%wa` in top/mpstat.
- `si/so` swap in/out: sustained non-zero values indicate memory pressure.
- Use `vmstat 1` for near-real-time view.

## 29. strace

- Compat: Linux; Requires: sysstat.

The mpstat command writes to standard output activities for each available
processor, processor 0 being the first one. Global average activities among all
processors are also reported.
Requires: sysstat.

Interpretation tips
- High `%iowait`: CPUs idle while waiting on disk IO (check iostat).
- High `%irq/%soft`: heavy interrupts/softirqs (often network or storage).
- High `%steal`: hypervisor stealing time (noisy neighbor in a VM).
- Compare per-core: hotspots can be isolated to specific cores (affinity).

- `CPU`: Processor number. The keyword all indicates that statistics are
  calculated as averages among all processors.
- `%usr`: Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at
  the user level (application).
- `%nice`: Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing
  at the user level with nice priority.
- `%sys`: Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at
  the system level (kernel). Note that this does not include time spent
  servicing hardware and software interrupts.
- `%iowait`: Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle during
  which the system had an outstanding disk I/O request.
- `%irq`: Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to service hardware interrupts.
- `%soft`: Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to service software interrupts.
- `%steal`: Show the percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the virtual
  CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was servicing another virtual processor.

- OOM evidence: `dmesg -T | grep -i oom` or `journalctl -k -g OOM`

## 35. free

- Compat: Linux; Requires: procps.

- `used` - Used memory (calculated as total - free - buffers - cache)
- `free` - Unused memory (MemFree and SwapFree in /proc/meminfo)
- `shared` - Memory used (mostly) by tmpfs (Shmem in /proc/meminfo)
- `buffers` - Memory used by kernel buffers (Buffers in /proc/meminfo)
- `cache` - Memory used by the page cache and slabs (Cached and SReclaimable in /proc/meminfo)
- `buff/cache` - Sum of buffers and cache
- `available` - Estimation of how much memory is available for starting new
  applications, without swapping. Unlike the data provided by the cache or free
  fields, this field takes into account page cache and also that not all
  reclaimable memory slabs will be reclaimed due to items being in use
  (MemAvailable in /proc/meminfo, available on kernels 3.14, emulated on
  kernels 2.6.27+, otherwise the same as free)

- `free -l`: show low-high memory breakdown
- `free --wide`: show free memory stats

Interpretation tips
- `available` approximates memory free for new apps without swapping; don't confuse `free` with usable memory.
- High `buff/cache` is normal; it's the page cache and reclaimable slabs.

Examples
- Human-readable snapshot: `free -h --wide`
- Example output:
  ```
                total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
  Mem:           31Gi        2.1Gi       22Gi        312Mi       7.2Gi        28Gi
  Swap:           8Gi           0B        8Gi

  - `pgpgout/s` - Total number of kilobytes the system paged out to disk per second.
- `fault/s` - Number of page faults (major + minor) made by the system per
  second. This is not a count of page faults that generate I/O, because some
  page faults can be resolved without I/O.
  - `majflt/s` - Number of major faults the system has made per second, those
    which have required loading a memory page from disk.
  - `pgfree/s` - Number of pages placed on the free list by the system per second.

    and swapcache) per second to satisfy its memory demands.
  - `%vmeff` - Calculated as pgsteal / pgscan, this is a metric of the
    efficiency of page reclaim. If it is near 100% then almost every page coming
    off the tail of the inactive list is being reaped. If it gets too low (e.g.
    less than 30%) then the virtual memory is having some difficulty. This
    field is displayed as zero if no pages have been scanned during the
    interval of time.

- `sar -d`: report activity for each block device
- `tps` - Total number of transfers per second that were issued to physical
  devices. A transfer is an I/O request to a physical device. Multiple logical

    avgrq-sz and was expressed in sectors.
  - `aqu-sz` - The average queue length of the requests that were issued to the
    device. Note: In previous versions, this field was known as avgqu-sz.
  - `await` - The average time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests issued to the
    device to be served. This includes the time spent by the requests in queue
    and the time spent servicing them.
  - `svctm` - The average service time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests that
    were issued to the device. Warning! Do not trust this field any more. This
    field will be removed in a future sysstat version.
  - `%util` - Percentage of elapsed time during which I/O requests were issued
    to the device (bandwidth utilization for the device). Device saturation
    occurs when this value is close to 100% for devices serving requests
    serially. But for devices serving requests in parallel, such as RAID arrays
    and modern SSDs, this number does not reflect their performance limits.

  With the FREQ keyword, statistics about CPU clock frequency are reported. The following value is displayed:
  - `wghMHz` - Weighted average CPU clock frequency in MHz. Note that the
    cpufreq-stats driver must be compiled in the kernel for this option to work.

  With the IN keyword, statistics about voltage inputs are reported. The following values are displayed:
  - `inV` - Voltage input expressed in Volts.
  - `%in` - Relative input value. A value of 100% means that voltage input has
    reached its high limit (in_max) whereas a value of 0% means that it has
    reached its low limit (in_min).
  - `DEVICE` - Sensor device name. 
  
  With the USB keyword, the sar command takes a snapshot of all the USB devices

## 53. btrace

- Compat: Linux; Wrapper script from blktrace; Root required.

- The btrace script provides a quick and easy way to do live tracing of block
  devices. It calls blktrace on the specified devices and pipes the output
  through blkparse for formatting. See blktrace (8) for more in-depth
  information about how blktrace works.

- `btrace /dev/sda`
Requires: blktrace.



## 54. tr

- Compat: Linux; Requires: coreutils.

Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard input, writing to standard output.

- `tr '\n' ','`: convert new lines to commas
- squeeze repeats: `tr -s ' ' < file` (collapse runs of spaces)
- delete chars: `tr -d '\r' < file` (remove CR)
- keep only printable: `tr -cd '[:print:]\n' < file`
- case convert: `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < file`

## 55. cut

- Compat: Linux; Requires: coreutils.

- select CSV fields: `cut -d, -f1,3 file.csv`
- ranges: `cut -d: -f1-3 /etc/passwd`
- bytes/chars: `cut -b1-10 file`; `cut -c1-20 file`
- complement: `cut -d, -f1 --complement file.csv`
- with headers: pair with `head -1` to see column indexes
## 56. xargs

- Compat: Linux; Requires: findutils; GNU `-r` may vary on BusyBox.

Build and run argument lists; combine with `find` and null-terminated records for safety.

- safe null delim: `find . -type f -name '*.log' -print0 | xargs -0 rm -f`
- limit args per call: `xargs -n 1 -I{} sh -c 'echo {}'`
- parallelism: `xargs -P 4 -n 1 cmd` (run 4 at a time)
- interactive confirm: `xargs -p rm` (ask before each batch)
- do nothing on empty input: `xargs -r cmd` (GNU)

## Logs & Systemd

Cheat Card
- Unit status: `systemctl status <unit>`; failed: `systemctl list-units --failed`
- Hot errors: `journalctl -xeu <unit>`; follow: `journalctl -fu <unit>`

# Failed units overview
systemctl list-units --failed
journalctl -xe  # recent critical logs

# Restart and verify logs from this boot

systemctl restart systemd-journald

# Tip: tune RateLimitIntervalSec/RateLimitBurst to manage log storms
```

Resolved (DNS)
```bash
